A command line tool for looking at the price of bitcoins from inside your terminal, like all the 1337 hackers do!.

# Will this get me all the moneys?
Yes

# Hey it isn't working!
Do you have `jq` in your path?  
What about gnuplot?
Curl?
Are you doing `watch -n 5 ./fetch_ticker.sh` and `gnuplot g_script.gplot` ? 
No idea
